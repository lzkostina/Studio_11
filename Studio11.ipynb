    "Gelman's [Folk Theorem of Statistical Computing](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2008/05/13/the_folk_theore/) states\n",

    "> _\"When you have computational problems, often there’s a problem with your model.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle means that computational difficulties (slow convergence, sensitivity to initialization, getting stuck in local optima) can reflect genuine statistical issues (weak identifiability, overparameterization, insufficient data). Today we will see an example of this; along the way, we'll practice making an algorithm more efficient and numerically stable."

    "### Defining a Gaussian Mixture Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) represents data as coming from a mixture of $K$ Gaussian distributions. The density of a GMM has the form:\n",
    "$$p(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{k=1}^K\\pi_k \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{x} | \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_k, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_k),$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "- $\\pi_k$ are mixing proportions (with $\\pi_k\\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{k=1}^K\\pi_k = 1$)\n",
    "- $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ are component means\n",
    "- $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d}$ are component covariance matrices (must be positive definite)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a sample of observations $(x_i)_{i=1}^n$ and wish to estimate the parameters of the GMM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Latent Variable Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "If $x_i$ is drawn from the GMM $p$, we can introduce a latent variable $z_i \\in {1, 2, ..., K}$ that indicates which Gaussian distribution $\\mathbf{x}_i$ came from, i.e.\n",
    "- $p(z_i = k) = \\pi_k$ (prior probability of component k)\n",
    "- $p(\\mathbf{x}_i | z_i = k) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{x}_i | \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_k, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_k)$ (likelihood given component)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we knew the $z_i$ values, parameter estimation would be easy: just compute sample means and covariances for each group! Since we don't know them, the _EM algorithm_ alternates between inferring the latent assignments and updating the parameters as if those inferred assignments were correct."
